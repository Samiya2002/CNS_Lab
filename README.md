## Usage:

Each Java file in this repository represents a specific cryptographic algorithm or concept. To run and test these implementations, you can use a Java development environment such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or compile and run them from the command line.

Ensure that you have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.

To compile and run a Java file from the command line:

```bash
javac FileName.java
java FileName
